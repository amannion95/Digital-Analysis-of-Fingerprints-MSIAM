# Digital-Analysis-of-Fingerprints-MSIAM
Class project to carry out digital image analysis of fingerprint images.

## Report Abstract
Given a set of optical greyscale fingerprint images, we will introduce mathematical filters and models we have created to simulate artefacts that could occur during the fingerprint acquisition. A simple statement of the motivation for this project is to try to answer the following question: given two images of the same finger, a "normal" one, and the other having some irregularity or mistake in the acquisition causing a visual artefact, how can one go from the first image to the second? The filters and models created will be implemented in C++.

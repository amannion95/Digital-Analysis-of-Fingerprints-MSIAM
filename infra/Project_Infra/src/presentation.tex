3 differents ways to translate picture :\\

	- moove each pixels one by one\\
	- scrop the zone which will still be in the picture after translation and paste it in a white picture\\
	- use the openCV function "warpAffine" with the right parameters which allow us to translate with floating parameters.\\
	
	

Many different ways to estimate the translation parameters $p_x$ and _$p_y$ assuming that they are discrete values. There is two of them :\\

	- The greedy one : go through the whole picture and try each translation combinations and, for all of these, compute the error.\\
	
	

	- A better one is locate the barycenter of both pictures, compare them and find two intervals (one for $p_x$ and one for_$p_y$). You will then be able to use the bruteforce algorithm described previously but only on these intervals.\\

The absolute error picture show us that the translation parameter is not an integer.\\

We have an approximation of the parameters. We looked for an algorithm which would be able to refine these ones.\\
In order to do that we find the point with the lowest error by adding k*0.1 to  $p_x^{*}$ and $p_y^{*}$ (k $\in [-10,10]$). this become the new ($p_x^{*},p_y^{*}$). Then we redo this with k*0.01 etc..
